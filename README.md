**Ethnicity, Democracy, and Household Consumption in Ethiopia
Thesis Overview**

This research investigates how household consumption in Ethiopia varies along ethnic lines during election years, comparing patterns across democratic and non-democratic eras. The study explores whether coethnic households—those sharing ethnicity with the ruling coalition—experience different consumption outcomes compared to non-coethnic households, particularly during politically sensitive periods.

**Research Question**
How does household consumption in Ethiopia vary along ethnic lines during election years, and does the nature of the political regime (democratic vs. non-democratic) influence this relationship?

**Abstract**
Using household survey data, this study examines the impact of ethnicity and political context on household consumption. The analysis reveals that both factors significantly affect consumption levels. Contrary to previous studies suggesting ethnic favoritism toward the Tigray region, this research finds no significant effect of democracy on household food security, regardless of ethnic alignment. Additionally, household-level controls (e.g., size, education, marital status) show minimal influence compared to ethnicity and political regime, suggesting that external factors are primary drivers of consumption patterns.

**Methodology**
A Difference-in-Differences (DID) quasi-experimental design is employed to estimate the treatment effect of coethnicity during election years. The study spans five national election years in Ethiopia: 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2018, comparing consumption across:

Coethnic regions: Dominant ethnic group aligns with the ruling coalition.
Non-coethnic regions: No alignment with the ruling coalition.

**Model Specifications**
Three DID models are estimated:

Simple DID Model
DID with Time Fixed Effects
DID with Region Fixed Effects

Each model is run with and without household-level controls:

Sex of household head
Marital status
Education level
Household size

Equations are specified to capture the interaction between coethnicity and democratic regime, isolating their joint effect on log-transformed per capita food consumption.

**Key Findings**

Ethnicity and political regime significantly influence household consumption.
Democracy does not improve food security for either coethnic or non-coethnic households.
Household controls have limited explanatory power compared to ethnicity and regime type.

**Implications**
These findings challenge assumptions about ethnic favoritism and democratic benefits in Ethiopia, suggesting that structural and political factors may outweigh household-level characteristics in shaping economic outcomes.
